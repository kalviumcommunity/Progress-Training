Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you'll need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. The JDK includes everything you need to compile and run Java programs. You can download the latest version of JDK from the official Oracle website: Java SE Downloads

You'll also need a code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java. An IDE provides a user-friendly environment for writing and running your Java code. Some beginner-friendly IDE options include:

BlueJ
DrJava
JGrasp
Choose the IDE that suits your preferences and install it on your system.

Contents
The repository is organized into several sections, each focusing on a specific topic or concept related to Java programming. Here's an overview of the contents that are particularly relevant for beginners:

Hello World: Start with the classic "Hello World" program, which introduces you to the basic structure of a Java program and how to print output to the console.

Variables: Learn how to declare and use variables to store different types of data, such as numbers and text, in your Java programs.

Operators: Understand the various operators available in Java, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators, and how to use them to perform calculations and make decisions.

Control Flow: Explore control flow statements, such as if-else, switch, and loops, which allow you to control the execution flow of your program based on certain conditions.

Functions: Learn how to define and call functions (also known as methods) in Java to organize and reuse code effectively.

Arrays: Understand how to work with arrays, which allow you to store and manipulate multiple values of the same type in Java.

Input and Output: Discover how to interact with the user by reading input from the keyboard and displaying output to the console.

Each section contains simple code examples and exercises to practice the concepts learned.
